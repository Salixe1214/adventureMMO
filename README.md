## Concept
There is 3 clans, each starting at an extremity of the map. In the center of the map, there is a tower. The first clan to reach the top of the tower get acces to a new world. The other clans can acces this world once they also have beaten the tower, but they lose control over the best territories.
Once your character die, it is permanetly dead if it isn't revived.
You have only one character untill it die (might change).
No class system, but there is levels and skill tree.
